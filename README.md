>## A Big Update Is Coming

>React Hot Loader 3 is [on the horizon](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/pull/240), and you can try it today ([boilerplate branch](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/pull/61), [upgrade example](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools/commit/64f58b7010a1b2a71ad16716eb37ac1031f93915)). It fixes some [long-standing issues](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/722040946075045888) with both React Hot Loader and React Transform, and is intended as a replacement for both. The docs are not there yet, but they will be added before the final release. For now, [this commit](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools/commit/64f58b7010a1b2a71ad16716eb37ac1031f93915) is a good reference.
